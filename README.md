### Welocme to my profile! ###

**Getting to know me**:

I am a recent graduate of DePaul University, having received my M.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2023. I also hold a B.A. in Economics from Depaul University, as well. So far in my career, I have worked in banking, doing work in business intelligence and data science roles. In the future, I am looking to move into a career in quantitative risk. I have considrable passion for the work that I do, and have loaded some projects from my graduate program as repositories to be explored. I hope to use this site as a resource to show my work and research. Feel free to check out the projects below.
